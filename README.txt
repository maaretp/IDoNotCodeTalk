This talk was prepared in 2014 as response to the forever discussions about everyone’s need to code - in future or right now. 

Delivered at:
- Talentum Software QA & Testing Summit 2014 (7.10.2014)

-- I don’t code, am I no longer useful? --

There's still a lot of discussion on whether testers should be able to code or not. While coding and understanding of code is a useful skill, this presentation sets out to remind us of the stuff that does not involve code but is definitely relevant in developing software. 

The presentation takes on a case view of things I do as a single "testing specialist" with a product development team of developers. We look at examples of things of value contributed as realised activities towards a common goal. 

While presented from a testers perspective, there will be a lot of aspects anyone interested in software development may find relevant and useful.

SHORT BULLET POINT DESCRIPTION OF THE TALK:
- New challenge: requiring coding skills from testers, how good do I need to be?
- Case: what a non-coding tester does in a product development team
- Examples from four essential areas of work
